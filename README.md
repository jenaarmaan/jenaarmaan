# Hi, I’m Armaan Samir Jena 👋

**Computer Science Engineer (AI) | Systems Builder**

I design and build **real-world, scalable systems** using **AI, Blockchain, and Cloud technologies**, with a focus on **healthcare, governance, and social impact**.  
My work emphasizes **system design, architectural clarity, and responsible engineering** over quick demos.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- AI-powered diagnostic and decision-support systems  
- Blockchain-based platforms focused on trust, transparency, and data integrity  
- Scalable full-stack applications with cloud-native backends  
- Social-impact technology in healthcare, governance, and sustainability  

I enjoy working on problems that require **both technical depth and real-world context**.

## ⚙️ Technical Focus

- System design and modular architecture  
- Applied machine learning (CV, OCR, NLP)  
- Blockchain and trust-based systems  
- Cloud-native development and deployment  
- Security, privacy, and ethical considerations in AI

## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy

I prefer to start with the **problem, users, constraints, and scale** before choosing tools or frameworks.

I treat AI as a **decision-support mechanism**, not a black box, and aim to build systems that are:
- reliable  
- maintainable  
- ethically grounded  
- practical in real-world environments

## 📌 Selected Repositories

A curated selection of repositories that reflect my core work:

- `medical-diagnostic-system`
- `blockchain-voting-system`
- `uemp-platform`
- `health-records-blockchain`

Each repository focuses on **clear problem statements, architecture, and design decisions**.
